# Senior-project-Fit-Talks-Forecasting-Fitness-Awareness-in-Saudi-Arabia-using-Fine-Tuned-Transformers
This study aims to utilize sentiment analysis to assess the awareness of health and fitness among Saudi Arabians. Motivated by the need to address regional health issues, the research focuses on analyzing Saudi content from the X platform (formerly Twitter). Utilizing the X application programming interface (API), we collected and extracted data employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Essential preprocessing steps such as normalization, stop word removal, and tokenization were applied to enhance data quality prior to analysis. We fine-tuned two transformer architectures, BERT and GPT, specifically using three BERT-based models (AraBERT, MARBERT, CamelBERT) and GPT-3.5, to identify the sentiment of health-related tweets. The study provides valuable insights into Saudi Arabian attitudes towards fitness and health, popular topics, and genuine expressions, offering actionable information for public health campaigns and initiatives.
